## Testing the frontend

## How the frontend interacts with the [backend](https://swimm-web-app.web.app/workspaces/mv2fxkk3cvcjEfSEo9pw/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBZmxhc2slM0ElM0FuYWRhdi1zd2ltbQ==/branch/main/docs/bi1yahys/edit#heading-Z1Q1vCR)

# Common issues in the frontend

The frontend of our system is built using Flask and follows a specific file structure and conventions. In order to avoid common issues, it is important to follow these conventions and best practices.

One common issue is related to the use of outdated or deprecated libraries. To avoid this, always make sure to update the libraries used in the frontend to their latest version.

Another common issue is related to the lack of testing. It is important to write tests for the frontend code to ensure that it works as expected and to catch any issues early on.

Finally, make sure to follow the file structure and conventions used in the frontend code. This includes importing modules and libraries correctly, as well as following naming conventions for variables and functions.
